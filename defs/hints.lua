	[[Consume captured elementals to upgrade your abilities.

Selecting an upgrade will release a captured elemental of each other type, so choose wisely.]],
	[[Not ready for the full Summoning? The Sandbox, found in the Menu, can be used to refine your technique.

Check the Grimoire for new information each time it is opened.]],
	[[Sigils towards an edge of the summoning circle bias your affinity toward that element.

Elemental affinity determines which type of elementals are summoned.]],
	[[Reach Lightning Level 2 to start inscribing hexagons.

Hexagons focus your affinity and summon a burst of elementals. Use them to boost your abilities, but be careful!]],
	[[Sigils lose power over time, and fade rapidly while actively draining essence from nearby elementals.

Larger sigils last longer, as do sigils created by a mage more versed in Fire.]],
	[[Squares are powerful, but cannot fully absorb elementals.

Triangles are weaker, but are the only basic sigil capable of full absorption.

A mix of sigils is best.]],
	[[Reach Level 8 Lightning to learn the secret of octagons.

Inscribe an octagon to complete The Summoning.]],
	[[Press [Space] or [X] to toggle between drawing lines and circles.

If a line or circle already exists between two points, then the other shape will be drawn.]],
	[[Move the view with the Arrow Keys or WSAD, as well as with the mouse.

Mouse scrolling can be turned off with Toggle Edge Scroll in the Menu.]],
	[[Click [Auto] to automatically upgrade an ability when able.

Automatic upgrades still release one elemental of each other type. First come, first served.]],
	[[Upgrade Water and Life to better weather the ravages of The Summoning.

Sometimes, rushing through a pack of elementals to draw a vital line is neccessary.]],
	[[Upgrade Ice and Air to avoid the lunges of elementals as your lure them into your sigils.

Elementals move at increased speed the longer they chase you.]],
	[[Upgrade Fire for more powerful sigils, and Lightning to maintain more at once.

Squares are much better at draining elemental essence than triangles, and larger sigils last longer.]],
	[[Upgrade Earth and Chalk to improve your ability to create and sustain circles and lines.

Circles push nearby elementals away when inscribed.]],
	[[Elementals become larger and more numerous over time.

Reach Level 8 Lightning and inscribe an octagon before you are overwhelmed!]],
	[[Lines that form the edge of at least one sigil fade much more slowly.

Lines that were part of a sigil fade rapidly once all their sigils are gone.]],
	[[Overlapping many sigils of the same type in one place is difficult.

Specifically, a sigil is only created if it would not share a corner, at the same orientation, with an existing sigil.]],
