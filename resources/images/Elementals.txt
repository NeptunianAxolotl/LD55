Elementals:

Lightning - increase damage/power of shapes so they are better at capturing elemental powers
Alternate between the three images, but maybe show two at once.

Water - recovers player health (conga-line)
Have water_1 and water_2 orbit around water_main.  Preferably by crossing in front and then crossing behind.  There could be up to approx 3 ish droplets orbiting at once.

Earth - stabilises lines
Slow rotation (like a boulder?)

Chalk - increases chalk refresh rate
Slighty faster rotation

Metal??? - increases max chalk

Air - increase player walking speed
Alternate between the three images.

Ice - slows down elementals
Surrounded by snow (effect similar to sparks)

Life/Plants - increases max health
Have life_1 and life_2 orbit around life_main.  Preferably by crossing in front and then crossing behind.  They should orbit much closer life_main than water.  And there can be more of them.

Fire(light) - attracts elementals
The three flames should be drawn on top of each other (fire_1 on the bottom), and slightly move in place against each other.  Possibly also add some sparks/embers?

Darkness/void - repels elementals
Alternate between the three pictures (don't overlay two at once because the transparency will be funny).  The order should be 1,2,3,2,1,2,3,2...
